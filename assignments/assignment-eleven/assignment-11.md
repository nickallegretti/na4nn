I plan on attending the Evolution Working Group call on April 8th at 9am

Podcast Reflections: I felt the podcast changed what I thought about open source projects in a couple ways. 
As a college student who was looking for an internship this summer, I has asked on multiple occasions if I 
have worked on any open soure projects. This gave me the idea that open source projects were mostly used as
resume builders or passion projects. This class as a whole, but specifically the podcast has changed my view on that.
Hearing a bunch of professionals discus how they ended up working on CHAOSS, and how some of them are empolyed through
much larger companies has changed how I thik about open source projects. The second thing I noticed was that many of the
members talking on the podcast work in multiple working groups. Iniitially I assumed that the working groups were meant to 
organize the contributors, but now I think its primarly to organize the data.
