Both "Why Contribute to Open Source Software" and "A Guide to Contributing to Open Source Software" primarily cover the 
incentive to contributing to open source projects. The first of the two, "Why Contribute to Open Source Software", primarly focuses on the
different reasons individuals may want to contribute to an open source projects. The article states that most people contribute for some 
monetary or own-use benefit. However, it also notes that there is still a percentage of contributors who do so with no monetary incentive.
The ladder article "A Guide to Contributing to Open Source Software" focueses primary on the benefit of open source projects to larger 
companies. The reason I think open source projects can have such a variety of contributors and reasons for contributing is because of the 
scope open source projects can cover. They include passion projects where no contributor expects any money for contributing and it includes
apis that companies like Google and Facebook may dedicate whole teams to contributing to. One thing I found interesting in the ladder 
article was how hording away you development on an open source project just for yourself was actually counter productive, and that 
companies that did often had to update their version of the software far more than they would need to if they just contributed to the 
project.
