One open source software liscense I would like to use for an open source project I develop in the future would be the Beer-Ware license. I
first heard about this license when reading the 24-questions paper for assignment 12. This license allows for free use of the software on 
the condition that if you use the software and feel the developer deserves a beer, you will buy them a beer. I like this license in 
particular because I feel open source projects can develop communites and liscenses like this help foster that.
