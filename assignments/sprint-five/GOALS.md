Google User Info Display Web App Project by Nick Allegretti

Currently this project allows a user to sign into their Google account, and then displays the information provided by Google. I made this project for the project to test the capabilities of an "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email" scope request, and to see what information Google shares with their base level scope. This app is intended for use by other Web Developers who plan on using Google OAuth in their own projects as a way to view what info associated with an account and see what info Google shares. By the final version of this app I plan to have a database store the userâ€™s info. On following sign ins the app will prompt the user if any of their user information has changed and give them the choice to update their data in the database or to leave the old record. Additionally, for the final submission I would like to include another Web App I made with the help of this one that also uses HybridAuth as a way to show this apps usefulness.
