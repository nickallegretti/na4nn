Character Creator Web App Project by Nick Allegretti


Initially I made this project to allow a user to sign into their Google account, and then displays the information provided by Google. I made this project for the project to test the capabilities of an OAuth scope requests, and to see what information Google shares with their base level scope. Unfortuenately, I found out rather quickly the limit of information provided by the basic scopes and decided to expand upon my initial idea. The app now functions as a companion app to my in development game 'Business with Friends'. The web app provides a character creator. Users can choose a preset character and edit that character's facial features. The eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth are all editable. Each parts position, color and scale can be changed. When a user is finished, and if they are signed in to Google through OAuth, they can upload their character as a preset for other users to use as a starting point. The original user info project I did for this has been reencorperated as a user profile page for the character creator. My goal is to have this page also show the user's total number of presets made as well as their total likes. In addition, I would like to give users the ability to sort by popularity, as well as search by creator.
