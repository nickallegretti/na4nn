Chracter Creator Web App
Project by Nick Allegretti

Since the last submission, I have managed to achieve all the goals I listed in the my-project slack channel. Those goals included a user page that shows the user's name, amount of submissions, amount of likes, profile picture and email.The web appliaciton also now features a like system that allows users to like a submission when viewing it. A user is not able to like a submission more than once. A user's total submission and total likes are now viewable on the user's page. The page also now features a search bar that lets you search for creators by name. In addition, the sort options now include options to sort by the most and least liked submissions. The sort feature and the search feature both work together. For example a user can search for a specific creator and then sort by most liked. Overall, I am very happy with how this project has turned out and will be adding it to my resume.
