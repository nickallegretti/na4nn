Chracter Creator Web App
Project by Nick Allegretti

Since the last submission, I have managed to achieve all the goals I listed in the my-project slack channel. Those goals included a user page that shows the user's name, amount of submissions, amount of likes, profile picture and email.The web appliaciton also now features a search bar that lets you search for creators by name. In addition, the sort option now includes options to sort by the most and least liked submissions. Overall, I am very happy with how this project has turned out and will be adding it to my resume.
